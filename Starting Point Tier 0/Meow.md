**Task 6:** What service do we identify on port 23/tcp during our scans?
Run:
`nmap -v -Pn -sT <IP address of machine>`
>-v = verbose 
>-Pn = skip host discovery
>-sT = TCP scan

Telnet

**Task 7:** What username is able to log into the target over telnet with a blank password?
Run:
`telnet -4 <IP address of machine>`
When prompted for username, enter root. 
When connected, run to list files because we're search for flag.txt:
