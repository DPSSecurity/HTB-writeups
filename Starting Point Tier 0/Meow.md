## Decription:
This is the very first box Hack The Box presents aspriring cybersecurity professionals with. In this box, we are asked to connect to the system using Telnet.<br>

## Solution:
<span style="color:lightskyblue">**Task 1:** What does the acronym VM stand for?</span><br>
Virtual Machine

**Task 2:** What tool do we use to interact with the operating system in order to issue commands via the command line, such as the one to start our VPN connection? Itâ€™s also known as a console or shell.<br>
Terminal

**Task 3:** What service do we use to form our VPN connection into HTB labs?<br>
openvpn

**Task 4:** What tool do we use to test our connection to the target with an ICMP echo request?<br>
ping

**Task 5:** What is the name of the most common tool for finding open ports on a target?<br>
nmap

**Task 6:** What service do we identify on port 23/tcp during our scans?<br>
Run:
`nmap -v -Pn -sT <IP address of machine>`
>-v = verbose<br> 
>-Pn = skip host discovery<br>
>-sT = TCP scan<br>

Telnet

**Task 7:** What username is able to log into the target over telnet with a blank password?<br>
Run:
`telnet -4 <IP address of machine>`<br> 

When prompted for the username, enter root.<br>

When connected, run to list files because we're searching for flag.txt:
`ls -alh`<br> 

When flag.txt is located, run:
`cat flag.txt`<br>
